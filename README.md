# Image-Based-Color-Corrector-Prediction
The idea is to build a webpage where it has:
frontend
database
ML
backend.
the user uploads his/her photo. and based on that we tell what color suits his/her face. based on the redness or dryness etc. 
main focus is on cheeks, chin, forehead and undereyes
need to add explainable AI explaining why you recommended what you recommended.
features to add:
    comparision of what you actually uploaded and what you recommended(generated picture for reference)
    or just state on what happens when you use what we recommend and state the issues(redness or pimples or allegery clearly)
how about adding a chatbot????
